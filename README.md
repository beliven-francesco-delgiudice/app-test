## General structure

- **android** Android specific codebase
- **ios** iOS specific codebase
- **public** Public web resources
- **resources** Static resources for native builds
- **src** Platform-agnostic codebase (uses [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/docs/vue/overview) with [Vue js](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html))
- **tests** Integration and E2E test suite

## Pre-requisites

- **NodeJS** >= 12 (<https://nodejs.org/en/download/>)
- **Xcode** (<https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/ios>)
- **Android Studio** (<https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/android>)

npm install

# Develop
ionic capacitor run ios
ionic capacitor run android
ionic serve

Version number:

- iOS: "MARKETING_VERSION"
- Android: "versionName"

Build number:

- iOs: "CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION"
- Android: "versionCode"

## Play Store

**Before building you will need to open the file _build.gradle_ to edit the _versionName_ and increase the _versionCode_ number.** \
To build the android app run `ionic capacitor build android`. \
After running the command, if not already opened, open Android Studio on the project. \
Go to _Build_ and then _Generate Signed Bundle/APK_. \
Select _Android App Bundle_ and then _Next_.

- The _Key store path_ is the unique path to the Key file. You can find it in the Heply Google Drive in the folder _Lima Corporate_ > _APP_ > _chiavi_ named as **Key Android**. Download it and insert the unique path.
- The _Key store password_ and the _Key password_ are the same, you can find them in the Heply password manager under **app key store password**.

The go _Next_, choose _release_ and press _Finish_. \
After finishing, you will see a notification in the bottom low corner titled **Generate Signed Bundle**. Press on the arrow and click on _locate_. \
There you will find the finished build as an .aab file, ready to be uploaded on the Play Store.

## App Store

To build the ios app run `ionic capacitor build ios`. \
After running the command, if not already opened, open XCode on the project by opening _App.xcodeproj_. \
In the top side of the window click on _App_ (next to Play and Pause) and select _Any iOS Device_. \
**Before archiving you will need to open the file _App.xcodeproj_ to edit the _Version_ and increase the _Build_ number.** \
Then in the top bar click on _Product_ and select _Archive_.

**Note:** If you encounter the "Capacitor not found" error, close XCode and open it by running `npx cap open ios` in the project repository.

After archiving, in the new window click on _Distribute app_, then always click on _Next_ until you read _Processing App..._\
Now click on Upload to automatically upload it on the app store.
